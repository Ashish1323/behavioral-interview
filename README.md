* Tell me something about yourself

I am Ashish, Final Year B.tech student pursing majors in computer science from DSU, bangalore.
Last summer I Interned as Digi Marketer for a firm and as a Frontend Designer for a startup to the build the app which used react native, I have spent most of time working on javascript frameworks and worked on node, react and expressjs. with use of them I have build few of projects such as Ecommerce app, Q/A app, and google clone.

Now apart from dev I like to practise leetcode and do participate in their contests on regular basis. also I like to spread my knowledge with my juniors and fellow friends with the medium of workshops, zoom calls or messages on linkedin.
